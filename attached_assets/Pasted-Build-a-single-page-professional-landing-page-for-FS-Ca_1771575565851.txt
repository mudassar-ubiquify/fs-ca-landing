Build a single-page professional landing page for FS Capital Group — Faheem Siddiqi's investing arm. Use a single index.html file with embedded CSS and JS. No frameworks — just clean HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Color palette: deep navy background #080d1a, slightly lighter sections #0d1526, gold accent #c9a84c, white body text #f0f0f0, muted text #9aa5b4
Typography: Google Fonts — use "DM Sans" for body and "DM Serif Display" for headings. Import both.
Gold horizontal rule dividers between sections
Subtle gold glow or border on hover states for cards and buttons
Fully responsive — mobile-first


Navigation (sticky, top):

Footer:

Very dark #050810, centered text
Logo/name: "FS Capital Group" in gold

SVG Skyline (just above footer):

Hand-coded SVG city skyline silhouette spanning 100% width — buildings of varying heights, widths, and window grid patterns. Dark navy-on-navy fill with a very subtle gold stroke at 12% opacity. Feels architectural and premium, not cartoonish. Include spires/antennas on select towers.
A faint gold gradient glow along the top edge of the skyline as if lit from above
Buildings animate in on page load — each grows from bottom up using staggered CSS scaleY animation (transform-origin: bottom), 80ms stagger between buildings


Parallax Scrolling:

Hero background image: parallax at 40% scroll speed using requestAnimationFrame
Cityscape image in Section 4: softer parallax at 20% scroll speed
SVG skyline: gentle upward parallax as user scrolls toward it, as if rising into view


Mouse Movement Effects:

Hero section: mouse-tracking parallax on the background image — shifts max ±15px in X/Y opposite to cursor direction. Use smooth lerp (linear interpolation) for fluid movement.
Hero section: second layer of 25 small semi-transparent gold particle dots at randomized positions that drift with mouse movement at a different speed to the background, enhancing depth
"How We Help" cards: CSS 3D tilt on hover — card subtly rotates on X/Y axis tracking cursor within the card (max 8 degrees). Gold specular highlight shifts with mouse position inside the card.


Scroll Animations:

Use IntersectionObserver to animate all sections into view: fade up + Y translate from 30px → 0
Stagger card animations with 100ms delay between each
All animations should feel smooth and premium — nothing bouncy or cheap


General Notes:

All Unsplash images load via direct URL with ?auto=format&fit=crop. Use CSS object-fit: cover for all images.
Global scroll-behavior: smooth
The overall feel should be a premium, confident investment firm — think understated luxury, not flashy. Let the dark palette, gold accents, and typography do the work.
